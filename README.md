# Introduction to NumPy

A comprehensive Jupyter notebook tutorial covering the fundamentals of numerical computing with Python and NumPy.

## 📋 Overview

This notebook provides a hands-on introduction to NumPy (Numerical Python), the foundational library for scientific computing in Python. It's designed for beginners who want to understand how to manipulate numerical data efficiently, which is essential for machine learning, data science, and scientific computing.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This tutorial covers the following key concepts:

- **NumPy Datatypes & Attributes**: Understanding the `ndarray` datatype and its properties
- **Creating Arrays**: Multiple methods to initialize arrays (zeros, ones, random, ranges)
- **Viewing Arrays & Matrices**: Indexing and accessing array elements
- **Manipulating & Comparing Arrays**: Operations on arrays and element-wise comparisons
- **Sorting Arrays**: Organizing data within arrays
- **Real-world Use Cases**: Practical examples of converting data into numerical formats

## 🚀 Why NumPy?

- **Speed**: NumPy operations are optimized using C, making them significantly faster than pure Python
- **Vectorization**: Efficient operations without explicit loops
- **Foundation**: NumPy is the backbone of libraries like Pandas, SciPy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow
- **Broadcasting**: Powerful feature that enables operations on arrays of different shapes

## 📚 Topics Covered

### 1. Datatypes and Attributes
- Scalars, vectors, and matrices
- Array dimensions (1D, 2D, 3D)
- Shape, size, and dtype attributes
- Integration with Pandas DataFrames

### 2. Creating Arrays
- `np.array()` - Creating arrays from lists/tuples
- `np.ones()` and `np.zeros()` - Arrays filled with ones or zeros
- `np.arange()` - Arrays with ranges of values
- `np.random` functions - Random number generation
- `np.random.seed()` - Reproducible pseudo-random numbers

### 3. Array Operations
- Indexing and slicing
- Array manipulation
- Element-wise operations
- Array comparison
- Sorting techniques

### 4. Practical Examples
- Converting real-world data to numerical formats
- Working with multi-dimensional data
- Integration with data science workflows

## 🛠️ Requirements

```python
numpy
pandas
matplotlib (for visualizations, if included)
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### The ndarray
The `ndarray` (N-dimensional array) is NumPy's main datatype - a flexible container for numerical data that supports:
- Multiple dimensions
- Efficient element-wise operations
- Broadcasting capabilities
- Integration with other scientific Python libraries

### Vectorization
NumPy achieves speed through vectorization, which performs operations on entire arrays without explicit Python loops, leveraging optimized C code behind the scenes.

## 📝 Examples Included

The notebook includes practical examples of:
- Creating various types of arrays
